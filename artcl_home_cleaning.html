                    <span class="artcl_txt">
                        <p>At first it can be difficult to decide where to begin, a house, big or small, can be overwhelming but if you look at it logically it’s actually pretty simple. It’s better to start from end to end, top to bottom so that you don’t make dirty what you already cleaned.</p>
                        <p>So, by this logic, pick an end of the house and make your way to the other end, ideally clean the rooms first and the main corridor (if you have one) progressively. Inside the rooms go from top to bottom seeing as gravity will mess your clean floor, clean all those forgotten shelfs.</p>
                        <p>When it comes to the kitchen sink, and there's no dishwasher, you just have to get organized, go from the smallest and least dirty to the largest and most.</p>
                        <p><span class="artcl_sub_titl">How to clean?</span></p>
                        <p>Be methodical, if you see the area as a grid it’ll simplify your perspective. Clean from the farthest point from the door and make your way back so that you don’t fatigue yourself by re-cleaning.</p>
                        <p>In the kitchen, before washing the dishes, put any plates or pans with residue stuck to them soaking in some hot water, this will hydrate the scraps and make it easier to remove.</p>
                        <p><span class="artcl_sub_titl">What products to use?</span></p>
                        <p>This is trickier but, again, not that hard. Read the labels and buy the products better suited for what you have to clean, if you have wood floors or furnishings it’s best to go that extra mile so that you don’t end up with it ruined. If you have tile floors, a bottle cap of an all-purpose product will most likely be more than enough, just keep an eye out for the water in the bucket so that you’re not cleaning with dirt.</p>
                        <p>When it comes to the dishes don’t be too stingy with the price, better for it to be effective with little quantities of the detergent than to not make any bubbles with loads of it.</p>
                        <p><span class="artcl_sub_titl">Closing observations</span></p>
                        <p>Don’t be lazy! You’re not in your parent’s house anymore and mama isn’t here to clean it up so get busy, or, better yet, clean after yourself. The house will be easier to clean if you keep it clean, a small peace at a time, as in not letting the dishes pile up for the hole week, will come a long way. If you live with your parents…come on man, help them out. At least clean your own room and take out the trash.</p>
